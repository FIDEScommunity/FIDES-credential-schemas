# FIDES Credential Schemas

This repository contains a collection of temporary JSON Schemas for SD-JWT VC and VCDM 2.0 based credentials to support Community Tracks and Open Sandbox environments.
Some of them are copies from other repositories.

## Status

These schemas are:
- Developed in the context of FIDES Community Tracks
- Aligned where possible with public standards
